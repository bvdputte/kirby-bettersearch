# Kirby Bettersearch plugin

A search plugin for Kirby 3 that searches for full word combinations rather than just individual words.

## Installation

- `git submodule add https://github.com/bvdputte/kirby-bettersearch.git site/plugins/kirby-bettersearch` or
- `composer require bvdputte/kirby-bettersearch`

## Usage

Instead of the default `$pages` [search method](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/objects/pages/search), use `$page->bettersearch($string, $options)` instead.
